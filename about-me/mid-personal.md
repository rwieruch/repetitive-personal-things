- Patreon

Hey there! I am Robin, a german software engineer and freelancer located in Berlin. In the past years, I have actively written on my blog about web development with JavaScript. During that time, I published two ebooks, one of them is given away for free, to educate students about the JavaScript library React. I love teaching, to share my knowledge with others, and would be curious if I can make my dream to become a full-time teacher reality. Therefore I started to use Patreon. If you like my content and want to support me, follow me on my journey and be my Patron! Read more about me on my website's about me page.
