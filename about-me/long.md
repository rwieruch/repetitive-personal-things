Robin Wieruch is a German software and web engineer who is dedicated to learn and teach programming in JavaScript. After obtaining his master's degree in computer science, he continued learning every day on his own. He gained experience from the startup world where he used JavaScript excessively during his professional time and spare time. It gave him the opportunity to teach others about these topics.

For a few years, Robin worked closely with a great team of engineers at a company called [Small Improvements](https://www.small-improvements.com/) developing large scale applications. The company offers a SaaS product that enables the customers to give feedback to their companies. This application is developed using JavaScript in the frontend and Java in the backend. In the frontend, the first iteration was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for the frontend application. After using Angular for more than two years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications back in the days. That's why the company made the final jump to React and Redux that has enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

During his time in the company, Robin regularly wrote articles about web development on his website. He received great feedback from people concerning his articles and that allowed him to improve his writing and teaching style. Article after article, Robin grew in his ability to teach others. His first article was packed with too much stuff which was quite overwhelming for students, but he improved it over time by focussing and teaching only one subject.

Nowadays, Robin is a self-employed teacher. He finds it to be a fulfilling activity seeing students thrive by giving them clear objectives and a short feedback loop. That's one thing you would learn at a feedback company, wouldn't you? But without coding himself, he wouldn't be able to teach things. That's why he invests his remaining time in programming.
